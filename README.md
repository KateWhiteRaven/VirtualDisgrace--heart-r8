#### The Virtual Disgrace Relay

Heavily based on the Turbo Safety Relay by Da Chrome and Toy Wylie.

This is the source code for the relay we include with disgraced collars to wear as extra accessory.

Planned here is to add texture pre-loaders for a more simple to understand graphical interface than the original Turbo Relay and Turbo Safety Relay uses, also for modularity, what happens will be a reduction in certain features, like for example the safeword lockout which we plan to keep in the source code as is but will handle the recommended way by removing the physical button on the GUI.
